{\it Replay attack} is an approach for acquiring the unauthorized access to the automatic speaker verification (SV) system by using targets' pre-recorded speech. This work investigates the usefulness of linear prediction (LP) residual signal and modelling of glottal flow derivative (GFD) signal to counter replay attacks. In detecting replay signals the major clues lie in tracing the record and playback devices characteristics that dominantly reflect at low frequency regions due to loud speaker, and at high frequency regions due to two-stage A/D conversions. In that direction, must of the attempts try to derive the discriminative feature directly from the speech signal. In signal processing terms, the speech signal can be represented as the response of a slow time-varying vocal-tract system excited by a fast time-varying impulse like excitation source. Due to the presence of vocal tract resonances, the playback device characteristics may distort more to the spectral patterns of impulse like excitation signal then the spectral pattern of speech signal. Based on the distribution nature of the mel-scale that tightly spaced in low frequency regions and reverse in inverse mel-scale, residual mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (RMFCC) and residual inverse mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (RIMFCC) features are derived from LP residual signal and glottal flow derivative mel frequency cepstral coefficients (GFDMFCC) are derived from GFD signal. The effectiveness of these features are demonstrated on ASVspoof2017 database.

In terms of equal error rate (EER), RMFCC features provide the best performance of 14.57\% and RIMFCC of 15.35\%. The fusion of RMFCC and RIMFCC features improves the performance to 10.14\%, that is comparatively better than the state-of-the-art spectral centroid magnitude coefficients (SCMC) feature performance of 11.49\% and constant Q cepstral coefficients (CQCC) of 15.12\%. The fusion of RMFCC, RIMFCC with CQCC and SCMC further improves the performance to 8.72\%. Further, the GFD signal based GFDMFCC provides an EER of 20.53\%. The fusion of GFDMFCC with CQCC and SCMC provides an EER of 8.18\%. These outcomes demonstrate the usefulness of excitation source information for developing countermeasures to replay attacks.

From the speech production point of view, a voiced speech signal is the output of slow time varying vocal tract system, excited by a fast time varying impulse like signal. Due to the presence of vocal tract resonances, the playback device characteristics may distort more to the spectral patterns of impulse like excitation signal then the spectral pattern of speech signal.

% Automatic speaker verification (ASV) is a task of validating the claimed identity through machine by using the information available in claimants speech samples. The extended reserach works over last few decades on speaker verification technology made the Automatic speaker verification (ASV) considerably mature,efficient, convenient, low-cost and reliable solution to biometric person authentication. ASV technology is finding its way into a growing array of commercial products and services. The ASV systems are often employed for remote access (without humans supervision), or through telephone channel, provoke the chance of spoof attacks, where an impostor can immitate any target by providing laterâ€™s false speech samples. Spoofing can be done in four ways like impersonation, voice conversion, speech synthesis and replay attacks. Replay attack is very easy to create, no signal processing knowledge require, only require a high quality record and replay device, which can be easily available at nominal price. This attracts the research community to develop countermeasures to replay attacks. In detecting replay signals the major clues lie in tracing the record and playback devices characteristics that dominantly reflect at low frequency regions due to loud speaker, and at high frequency regions due to two-stage A/D conversions. Unlike speech, the spectral pattern of the impulse-like linear prediction (LP) residual signal is spread across entire frequency range, and so conjectured to be more useful. Based on the distribution nature of the mel-scale that tightly spaced in low frequency regions and reverse in inverse mel-scale, residual mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (RMFCC) and residual inverse mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (RIMFCC) features are used as the representative features.

% In that direction most of the attempts try to capture the trace of the playback device characteristics by using spectral related information, that remain almost intact in replay signals, due to the presence of high energy formants, resulting higher error in replay attacks detection task. In this work, we explore the use of linear prediction (LP) residual signal and glottal flow derivative (GFD) signals to counter replay attacks. The LP residual obtained by substracting the dominant energy (Resonances) from the speech signal and the GFD signal is obtained from the speech signal by deconvoling the vocal tract system responce using complex cepstrum decomposition method.
